# Employee Tracker

## Description
Employee Tracker is an app used in the command line, and it allows users to keep track of information regarding their teams. In this version of the app, users are able to add/view existing employees, employee roles, and departments. Additionally, users are able to update the roles of existing employees.

## Installation
Before you can use the Employee Tracker, you will need to download the necessary npm packages. To do so, change directories in the command line interface to the 'employee-tracker' folder. Then type ```npm install```. You should now have all of the required npm packages installed to be able to use this app. See the next section for usage instructions.

## Usage
Before you're able to run this app, you will have to enter your MySQL ```user``` and ```password``` information in the "index.js" file. You will also need to create the database and required tables. You can do this by entering the contents of the file "schema.sql" into MySQL Workbench (though feel free to leave out the dummy values I have provided).

You are now in a position to run the app. Simply type ```node index.js``` into the command line to start the app.
